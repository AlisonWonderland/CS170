# 8-puzzle
start with 4-puzzle
generate a tree.
add nodes that are available, check for dupes, if for one node there is a dupe, don't create child, if there is two dupes, then stop expanding, return null?

Test out the tree first
## Todo 
* Solve it without using node
* Maybe create a state class(Problem) to store the state of the puzzle
* Node could contain the state
* Algorithm classes focus on Uniformed first
* Ask on piazza what we should print out. Like the states being expanded until the solution.
